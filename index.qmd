Hi! I am a senior pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at Hope College. A quick learner, detail-oriented, and a problem-solver at heart, I am especially interested in Data Analytics and I am actively seeking opportunities related to the same.

Take a look around my projects... maybe you will find something of interest!
